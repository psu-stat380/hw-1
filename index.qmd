## Question 1

::: callout-tip
## 20 points
:::

In this question, we will walk through the process of *forking* a `git`
repository and submitting a *pull request*.

1.  Navigate to the Github repository
    [here](https://github.com/psu-stat380/hw-1) and fork it by clicking
    on the icon in the top right

![](images/fork.png)

> Provide a sensible name for your forked repository when prompted.

2.  Clone your Github repository on your local machine

    ``` bash
    $ git clone <<insert your repository url here>>
    $ cd hw-1
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use Github codespaces to get started from
    your repository directly.

3.  In order to activate the `R` environment for the homework, make sure
    you have `renv` installed beforehand. To activate the `renv`
    environment for this assignment, open an instance of the `R` console
    from within the directory and type

    ``` r
    renv::activate()
    ```

    Follow the instrutions in order to make sure that `renv` is
    configured correctly.

4.  Work on the *reminaing part* of this assignment as a `.qmd` file.

    -   Create a `PDF` and `HTML` file for your output by modifying the
        YAML frontmatter for the Quarto `.qmd` document

5.  When you're done working on your assignment, push the changes to
    your github repository.

6.  Navigate to the original Github repository
    [here](https://github.com/psu-stat380/hw-1) and submit a pull
    request linking to your repository.

    Remember to **include your name** in the pull request information!

If you're stuck at any step along the way, you can refer to the
[official Github docs
here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
[^1]

[^1]: I was unable to render the pdf file at first. I upgrade R version and all
    the packages, followed the instructions returned by "renv::status()"
    and synchronized the project with the lockfile. I'm not sure if
    these are the right process to solve the problem but I did
    successfully rendered pdf after these steps.

## Question 2

::: callout-tip
## 30 points
:::

Consider the following vector

```{R}
my_vec <- c(
    "+0.07",
    "-0.07",
    "+0.25",
    "-0.84",
    "+0.32",
    "-0.24",
    "-0.97",
    "-0.36",
    "+1.76",
    "-0.36"
)
```

For the following questions, provide your answers in a code cell.

1.  What data type does the vector contain?

```{R}
    typeof(my_vec)
```

2.  Create two new vectors called `my_vec_double` and `my_vec_int` which
    converts `my_vec` to Double & Integer types, respectively,

    ```{R}
    my_vec_double <- as.double(my_vec)
    my_vec_double
    my_vec_int <- as.integer(my_vec)
    my_vec_int
    ```

3.  Create a new vector `my_vec_bool` which comprises of:

    -   `r TRUE`if an element in `my_vec_double` is $\le 0$
    -   `r FALSE` if an element in `my_vec_double` is $\ge 0$

    ```{R}
    my_vec_bool <- ifelse(my_vec_double<=0, yes = TRUE, no = FALSE)
    # ifelse(my_vec_double<=0, TRUE, FALSE)
    # my_vec_bool <- my_vec_double<=0
    my_vec_bool
    ```

    How many elements of `my_vec_double` are greater than zero?

    ```{R}
    sum(my_vec_double > 0)
    ```

4.  Sort the values of `my_vec_double` in ascending order.

    ```{R}
    sort(my_vec_double)
    ```

## Question 3

::: callout-tip
## 50 points
:::

In this question we will get a better understanding of how `R` handles
large data structures in memory.

1.  Provide `R` code to construct the following matrices: $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & 2 & 3\\
    4 & 5 & 6\\
    7 & 8 & 9\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \quad \text{ and } \quad
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & \dots & 100\\
    1 & 4 & 9 & 16 & 25 & \dots & 10000\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

    ```{R}
    mygenerate_matrix1 <- function(n){
        return(
            matrix(
                1:n^2,
                ncol=n,
                byrow = T
            )
        )
    }
    mymatrix1 <- mygenerate_matrix1(3)
    mymatrix1
    ```

    ```{R}
    row1 = 1:100
    row2 = row1^2

    mymatrix2 <- matrix(
                    data = c(row1,row2),
                    ncol=length(row1),
                    byrow = T
    )
    mymatrix2
    ```

## Tip

Recall the discussion in class on how `R` fills in matrices
:::

In the next part, we will discover how knowledge of the way in which a
matrix is stored in memory can inform better code choices. To this end,
the following function takes an input $n$ and creates an $n \times n$
matrix with random entries.

```{R}
generate_matrix <- function(n){
    return(
        matrix(
            rnorm(n^2),
            nrow=n
        )
    )
}
```

For example:

```{R}
generate_matrix(4)
```

Let `M` be a fixed $50 \times 50$ matrix

```{R}
M <- generate_matrix(50)
mean(M)
```

2.  Write a function `row_wise_scan` which scans the entries of `M` one
    row after another and outputs the number of elements whose value is
    $\ge 0$. You can use the following **starter code**

``` r
row_wise_scan <- function(x){
    n <- nrow(x)
    m <- ncol(x)

    # Insert your code here
    count <- 0
    for(...){
        for(...){
            if(...){
                count <- count + 1 
            }
        }
    }

    return(count)
}
```

```{R}
row_wise_scan <- function(x){
    n <- nrow(x)
    m <- ncol(x)

    # Insert your code here
    count <- 0
    for(i in 1:n){
        for(j in 1:m){
            if(x[i,j] >= 0){
                count <- count + 1 
            }
        }
    }

    return(count)
}
row_wise_scan(M)
#system.time({row_wise_scan(M)})
```

3.  Similarly, write a function `col_wise_scan` which does exactly the
    same thing but scans the entries of `M` one column after another

``` r
col_wise_scan <- function(x){
    count <- 0
    
    ... # Insert your code here

    return(count)
}
```

```{R}
col_wise_scan <- function(x){
    count <- 0
    
    # Insert your code here
    n <- nrow(x)
    m <- ncol(x)
    
        for(i in 1:m){
        for(j in 1:n){
            if(x[j,i] >= 0){
                count <- count + 1 
            }
        }
        }
    
    return(count)
}
col_wise_scan(M)
```

You can check if your code is doing what it's supposed to using the
function here[^2]

[^2]: If your code is right, the following code should evaluate to be
    `TRUE`

    ``` r
    sapply(1:100, function(i) {
        x <- generate_matrix(100)
        row_wise_scan(x) == col_wise_scan(x)
    }) %>% sum == 100
    ```

4.  Between `col_wise_scan` and `row_wise_scan`, which function do you
    expect to take shorter to run? Why?

    The `col_wise_scan` suppose to run faster because in r the matrix is
    stored by columns, which means they are stored one columns after
    other. When R is search one columns after other, it can follow the
    sequence that the data were stored. Whereas when the code asks to
    search row by row, R in the memory need to jump around to find the
    right data(entries).

5.  Write a function `time_scan` which takes in a method `f` and a
    matrix `M` and outputs the amount of time taken to run `f(M)`

``` r
time_scan <- function(f, M){
    initial_time <- ... # Write your code here
    f(M)
    final_time <- ...  # Write your code here
    
    total_time_taken <- final_time - initial_time
    return(total_time_taken)
}
```

```{R}
time_scan <- function(f, M){
    initial_time <- Sys.time() # Write your code here
    f(M)
    final_time <- Sys.time()  # Write your code here
    
    total_time_taken <- final_time - initial_time
    return(total_time_taken)
}
```

Provide your output to

``` r
list(
    row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, M),
    col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, M)
)
```

```{R}
list(
    row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, M),
    col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, M)
)
```

Which took longer to run?

`row_wise_scan` took longer to run.

6.  Repeat this experiment now when:
    -   `M` is a $100 \times 100$ matrix

        ```{R}
        M <- generate_matrix(100)

        list(
            row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, M),
            col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, M)
        )
        ```

    -   `M` is a $1000 \times 1000$ matrix

        ```{R}
        M <- generate_matrix(1000)
        list(
            row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, M),
            col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, M)
        )
        ```

    -   `M` is a $5000 \times 5000$ matrix

        ```{R}
        M <- generate_matrix(5000)
        list(
            row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, M),
            col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, M)
        )
        ```

What can you conclude?

It is faster to search columns by columns.
