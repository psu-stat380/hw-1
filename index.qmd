## Question 1

::: callout-tip
## 20 points
:::

In this question, we will walk through the process of *forking* a `git`
repository and submitting a *pull request*.

1.  Navigate to the Github repository
    [here](https://github.com/psu-stat380/hw-1) and fork it by clicking
    on the icon in the top right

![](images/fork.png)

> Provide a sensible name for your forked repository when prompted.

2.  Clone your Github repository on your local machine

    ``` bash
    $ git clone <<insert your repository url here>>
    $ cd hw-1
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use Github codespaces to get started from
    your repository directly.

3.  In order to activate the `R` environment for the homework, make sure
    you have `renv` installed beforehand. To activate the `renv`
    environment for this assignment, open an instance of the `R` console
    from within the directory and type

    ``` r
    renv::activate()
    ```

    Follow the instrutions in order to make sure that `renv` is
    configured correctly.

4.  Work on the *remaining part* of this assignment as a `.qmd` file.

    -   Create a `PDF` and `HTML` file for your output by modifying the
        YAML frontmatter for the Quarto `.qmd` document

5.  When you're done working on your assignment, push the changes to
    your github repository.

6.  Navigate to the original Github repository
    [here](https://github.com/psu-stat380/hw-1) and submit a pull
    request linking to your repository.

    Remember to **include your name** in the pull request information!

If you're stuck at any step along the way, you can refer to the
[official Github docs
here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Question 2

::: callout-tip
## 30 points
:::

Consider the following vector

```{R}
my_vec <- c(
    "+0.07",
    "-0.07",
    "+0.25",
    "-0.84",
    "+0.32",
    "-0.24",
    "-0.97",
    "-0.36",
    "+1.76",
    "-0.36"
)
```

For the following questions, provide your answers in a code cell.

1.  What data type does the vector contain?
```{r}
typeof(my_vec)
```

2.  Create two new vectors called `my_vec_double` and `my_vec_int` which
    converts `my_vec` to Double & Integer types, respectively,
```{r}
my_vec_double <- as.numeric(my_vec)
my_vec_double
typeof(my_vec_double)

my_vec_int <- as.integer(my_vec)
my_vec_int
typeof(my_vec_int)
```

3.  Create a new vector `my_vec_bool` which comprises of:

    -   `r TRUE`if an element in `my_vec_double` is $\le 0$
    -   `r FALSE` if an element in `my_vec_double` is $\ge 0$

    How many elements of `my_vec_double` are greater than zero?
    
```{r}
my_vec_bool <- c()
count = 0

for (i in my_vec_double) {
  if (i > 0) {
    my_vec_bool <- append(my_vec_bool, "TRUE", after = length(my_vec_bool))
    count <- count + 1
  }
  else{
        my_vec_bool <- append(my_vec_bool, "FALSE", after = length(my_vec_bool))
  }
}
my_vec_bool
print(paste("There are", count, "elements in 'my_vec_double' greater than zero"))
```

4.  Sort the values of `my_vec_double` in ascending order.
```{r}
sort(my_vec_double)
```

## Question 3

::: callout-tip
## 50 points
:::

In this question we will get a better understanding of how `R` handles
large data structures in memory.

1.  Provide `R` code to construct the following matrices: $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & 2 & 3\\
    4 & 5 & 6\\
    7 & 8 & 9\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \quad \text{ and } \quad
    \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & \dots & 100\\
    1 & 4 & 9 & 16 & 25 & \dots & 10000\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

::: callout-warning
## Tip

Recall the discussion in class on how `R` fills in matrices
:::
```{r}
matrix(
  c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9),
  nrow = 3, 
  byrow = TRUE
)
```
```{r}
matrix(
  c((1:100),(1:100)^2),
  nrow = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
)
```


In the next part, we will discover how knowledge of the way in which a
matrix is stored in memory can inform better code choices. To this end,
the following function takes an input $n$ and creates an $n \times n$
matrix with random entries.

```{R}
generate_matrix <- function(n){
    return(
        matrix(
            rnorm(n^2),
            nrow = n
        )
    )
}
```

For example:

```{R}
generate_matrix(4)
```

Let `M` be a fixed $50 \times 50$ matrix

```{R}
M <- generate_matrix(50)
mean(M)
```

2.  Write a function `row_wise_scan` which scans the entries of `M` one
    row after another and outputs the number of elements whose value is
    $\ge 0$. You can use the following **starter code**

``` {r}
row_wise_scan <- function(x){
    n <- nrow(x)
    m <- ncol(x)

    # Insert your code here
    count <- 0
    for(row in 1:n){
        for(col in 1:m){
            if(x[row,col] >= 0){
                count <- count + 1
            }
        }
    }

    return(count)
}
```

3.  Similarly, write a function `col_wise_scan` which does exactly the
    same thing but scans the entries of `M` one column after another

``` {r}
col_wise_scan <- function(x){
    count <- 0
    # Insert your code     
    n <- nrow(x)
    m <- ncol(x)
    for(col in 1:m){
        for(row in 1:n){
            if(x[row,col] >= 0){
                count <- count + 1
            }
        }
    }

    return(count)
}
```

You can check if your code is doing what it's supposed to using the
function here[^1]

[^1]: If your code is right, the following code should evaluate to be
    `TRUE`

    ``` {r}
    library(tidyverse)
    sapply(1:100, function(i) {
        x <- generate_matrix(100)
        row_wise_scan(x) == col_wise_scan(x)
    }) %>% sum == 100
    ```

4.  Between `col_wise_scan` and `row_wise_scan`, which function do you
    expect to take shorter to run? Why?
    
    I would think that the 'col_wise_scan' would take shorter to run. I think
    this because matrices in R naturally fill column by column, so I feel as if
    code that scans in the same way as how the matrix is filled, will result in 
    a quicker scan of the matrix.

5.  Write a function `time_scan` which takes in a method `f` and a
    matrix `M` and outputs the amount of time taken to run `f(M)`

``` {r}
time_scan <- function(f, M){
    initial_time <- Sys.time()
    f(M)
    final_time <- Sys.time()
    
    total_time_taken <- final_time - initial_time
    return(total_time_taken)
}
```

Provide your output to

``` {r}
list(
    row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, M),
    col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, M)
)
```

Which took longer to run?

The row_wise_scan function took longer to run than the
col_wise_scan function. 

6.  Repeat this experiment now when:
    -   `M` is a $100 \times 100$ matrix
```{r}
M <- generate_matrix(100)
list(
    row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, M),
    col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, M)
)
```


    -   `M` is a $1000 \times 1000$ matrix
```{r}
M <- generate_matrix(1000)
list(
    row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, M),
    col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, M)
)
``` 


    -   `M` is a $5000 \times 5000$ matrix
```{r}
M <- generate_matrix(5000)
list(
    row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, M),
    col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, M)
)
```

What can you conclude?

After running the time scans for both matrix scanning methods on various size 
matrices, I conclude that the col_wise_scan is faster than the row_wise_scan. 
The time difference starts out pretty small but as you increase the size of the 
matrix, the col_wise_scan begins to get noticeably quicker than the 
row_wise_scan
